      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>Physical aspect</li>
        <dt>Physically change was one of the things I least expected
          when I grew up like I really think about but now I am rather insecure <br>
          talking about it, unless on paper though/digital.
          "It was a blast, A one in a life time phenomenon that one's can't forget."...
          <br><br>
          Primarily i started developing pubic hair. and it seems odd at first. and then
          Facial Hair started growing i was excited at first then. my nephew told me i looked like a goat
        </dt>
        <li>Emotional aspect</li>
        <dt>Emotionally, emotionally I am not stable during puberty. I am this typical edgy person that you will see somewhere that always wear headset.
        yeah. Not very healthy. but good thing i've experience being like that. <br><br>
        Emotionally unstable. I was the typical dead kid you'll ever find in a party.
        </dt>
        <li>Social aspect</li>
        <dt>Social I could say I am fine because I was able to do class and Orchestra during that time. like weekday schools then weekends I goes to Ortigas
        it was on benpres. but now that building has been demolished. I'm friendly, just don't talk to me when i seem tired because you're gonna get ghosted or flamed.
        </dt>
        <li>Psychological aspect</li>
        <dt>Well, Uhmm, I could says there was change in mental cognition and formulation but it was something that I was afraid of... I hate change.
         Yeah, whether if it's good or bad.
         I always ask advice to my music mentor since obviously older than me. has a great realationship to basically everyone i could say he's my Idol.
        </dt>
        <li>Intellectual aspect</li>
        <dt>Well, My Father push himself for me to get into a school that i don't really want. and also i don't want to hurt his expectations.
          it's like a mirror thingy like when i hurt someone i was able to imagine where it hits or hurts. yeah. and it's like synaesthesia but for sensation.
          Aside from this weird stuff i grew fond of learning math and most likely logic. such as logic gates.
        </dt>
        <li>Spiritual aspect.</li>
        <dt>I'll was active follower of christ when i was young. because most of my music studies revolves around it. and i still like them but just the MUSIC not christ.</dt>
