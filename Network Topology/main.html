    <h3>Bus Topology</h3>
    <p class="indent">A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus.</p>
    <h3>Ring Topology</h3>
    <p class="indent">A ring network is a network topology in which each node connects to exactly two other nodes, forming a single continuous pathway for signals through each node â€“ a ring.</p>
